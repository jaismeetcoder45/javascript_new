Javascript :- 
    is a synchoronous 
    is a single threaded
    (IT IS DEFAULT)
Execution context:-
    1. execute one line of code at a time
    (each operations wait for the last one to complete for its own execution)

Blocking vs non blocking code:-
    blocking - block the flow of program 
               read file sync
    non blocking - dont block execution
                   read file async

JS engine is composed of memory heap and call stack, web API, task queue

    in call stack first goes global then function memory stack
